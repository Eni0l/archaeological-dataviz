# archaeological-dataviz
In this project, we used data visualization tools to create a heatmap showing the distribution of chemical elements in an archaeological site. My role was to convert raw data into graphics that displayed these distribution patterns. These visuals simplified complex data and were key in forming the project's conclusions.
