# archaeological-dataviz
In this project, we used data visualization tools to create a heatmap showing the distribution of chemical elements in an archaeological site. My role was to convert raw data into graphics that displayed these distribution patterns. These visuals simplified complex data and were key in forming the project's conclusions.
# Archaeological Data Visualization Project

In this project, my team and I used data visualization tools to create a comprehensive heatmap that visually represented the distribution of chemical elements within various areas of a specific archaeological site.

## Goals
The main goal was to translate raw data into visually compelling graphics that showcased the precise distribution patterns of these elements. 

## My Role
I was responsible for transforming the raw data into visually compelling graphics that accurately displayed the distribution patterns of these elements.

## Results
The resulting data visualizations not only made complex information accessible but also played a pivotal role in shaping the project's findings. These visuals simplified intricate archaeological data, making it comprehensible to a wider audience and contributing significantly to our understanding of the site.
